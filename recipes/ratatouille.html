    <h2 class="subtitle">From the movies to the Real Life: Ratatouille</h2>
    <p>
      This ratatouille recipe is my version of the terrific French vegetable
      stew made with fresh tomatoes and lots of summer vegetables. It's very
      versatile side dish and makes a delicious vegetarian main dish, too.
    </p>

    <h2 class="subtitle">Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
      <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 eggplant, cut into 1/2 inch cubes</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons dried parsley</li>
      <li>salt to taste</li>
      <li>1 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>2 zucchini, sliced</li>
      <li>2 large tomatoes, chopped</li>
      <li>2 cups sliced fresh mushrooms</li>
      <li>1 large onion, sliced into rings</li>
      <li>1 green or red bell pepper, sliced</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="subtitle">Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat the bottom and
        sides of a 1 1/2-quart casserole dish with 1 tablespoon olive oil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in a medium skillet over medium
        heat. Cook and stir garlic until fragrant and golden brown. Add eggplant
        and parsley; cook and stir until eggplant is tender and soft, about 10
        minutes. Season with salt to taste.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spread eggplant mixture evenly across the bottom of the prepared
        casserole dish; sprinkle with a few tablespoons of Parmesan cheese.
        Spread zucchini in an even layer over top. Lightly salt and sprinkle
        with a little more cheese. Continue layering in this fashion, with
        tomatoes, mushrooms, onion, and bell pepper, covering each layer with a
        sprinkling of salt and cheese.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in preheated oven until vegetables are tender, about 45 minutes.
      </li>
    </ol>
